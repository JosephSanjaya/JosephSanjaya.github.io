Hi! I am a Android Enthusiast ðŸ“± with over seven years of dedicated experience, and I am driven by a deep passion for technology. My strong background in Android development is supported by a consistent track record of delivering innovative solutions while keeping up with the latest industry trends.

In addition to my technical skills, I have an eye for talent in the Android field and can identify and nurture top-tier talent within the industry. My commitment to excellence is also demonstrated through my role as a technology researcher where I continuously explore new ways to improve our dynamic field.

As a Senior Software Engineer (Android) at <a href='https://awantunai.co.id/'>AwanTunai</a>, my previous role involved significant contributions towards developing cutting-edge tools and improving services for our teams through integration of state-of-the-art systems.

Apart from my professional life, I am also an accomplished creative designer who enjoys making captivating 3D art. Outside work, I like meeting new people over coffee.
